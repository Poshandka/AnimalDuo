# AnimalDuo

[简体中文](README.md) · English

Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0.3 Apple extensions for iPad, iPhone and Mac, including the portrait companion.

This source snapshot extends [nxnative](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative) at revision b7a5cd43453722d448e07407d88a9c05ed294492 for Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0.3 on Apple platforms. It includes the resident-dialogue update and the earlier companion, input, save and renderer changes.

See [PUBLIC-SOURCE.md](PUBLIC-SOURCE.md) for features, build inputs, dependencies, privacy exclusions and validation limits. The build guidance and upstream acknowledgements follow below. This dedicated snapshot includes the Animal Crossing profile; other-game shader indices and the screenshot gallery are omitted.

# nxnative

Play your own Nintendo Switch games natively on iPhone and iPad. Bring your game (its NSP files) and your `prod.keys`; one script turns them into an IPA that you sideload.

It is not an emulator: the game's own code runs directly on the Apple chip, with Switch graphics rebuilt on Metal. Nothing from any game is in this repository, and the project is not affiliated with Nintendo or any game publisher.

## Acknowledgements

This project is built on other people's work:

- **[d2r-mobile](https://github.com/jhaizhou-ops/d2r-mobile)** (MIT) developed this native-execution approach, for Diablo II: Resurrected. nxnative started as a copy of its generic parts: the NSO rewriter, the host that stands in for Horizon, the NVN-on-Metal layer and the iOS app shell. Fixes go both ways.
- **Ryujinx** (MIT): its shader translator (`Ryujinx.Graphics.Shader`, `Ryujinx.Common` and `Spv.Generator` 1.3.2, in `dm/third_party/ryujinx` with a few fixes listed in [its README](dm/third_party/ryujinx/README.md)) turns the games' Maxwell shaders into SPIR-V. Its emulation of the kernel and system services is also a reference when the host's behaviour is in doubt.
- **[Atmosphère](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)**: its kernel, mesosphère, is the reference for Horizon's synchronization semantics (address arbiter, condition variables).
- **yuzu**: Maxwell instruction encodings for the shader reference tool, and a cross-check for kernel behaviour.
- **[LibHac](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/LibHac)**: reads NSPs and layers updates over the base game in `dm/tools/nx_extract`. **hactool** did the first extractions.
- **[SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross)**: SPIR-V to Metal Shading Language. **[glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang)** compiles the GLSL of OpenGL games to SPIR-V for it.
- **deko3d** (zlib): its texture layout size algorithm is ported in `dm/gfx/nvn/nvn_tex.c`.
- **libvpx** (VP9 movies), **stb_vorbis** (movie sound), the **Vulkan headers** and **NVIDIA FLIP** ship in `dm/third_party` with their licenses ([list](dm/third_party/README.md)).
- **Capstone**, **lz4**, **fontTools** and **XcodeGen** are used by the build.

## Games

AnimalDuo includes the complete Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0.3 profile for
iPad, iPhone and Apple Silicon Mac. See its [profile note](dm/games/01006F8002326000/README.md)
and [Chinese build guide](docs/BUILD.zh-CN.md) for features, inputs and validation limits.
The [pinned upstream compatibility list](https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/blob/b7a5cd43453722d448e07407d88a9c05ed294492/dm/games/README.md#games)
describes other titles in nxnative, outside this dedicated snapshot.

The 77-game gallery and other-game shader indices were removed to reduce source
downloads. Small metadata-only fixtures retain generic tooling tests; the runtime,
dependencies, licenses and complete ACNH shader/prewarm inputs remain unchanged.

## Download a small source snapshot

Use GitHub's **Code → Download ZIP** on `main`, or clone only the latest revision:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ShawndYang/AnimalDuo.git
cd AnimalDuo
```

Older commits and releases are retained for traceability. A full-history clone
can still download the removed files; this cleanup does not rewrite Git history.

## Pack an IPA

Prefer a graphical interface to the command line? **[NX2Apple](https://github.com/LNPANDY/NX2Apple)** is a community fork with a macOS app that runs this whole pipeline for you and packs the game files into a sharded RomFS archive for a slimmer IPA. It is a separate project that follows this one; the steps below are nxnative's own command-line way.

**1. Get nxnative and its tools** (once, on a Mac with [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)):

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ShawndYang/AnimalDuo.git
cd AnimalDuo
brew install xcodegen zstd spirv-cross glslang
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk
python3 -m pip install lz4 capstone fonttools "backports.zstd; python_version < '3.14'"
```

**2. Put one game's NSPs in a folder**: the base game (an NSP, or an XCI cartridge dump), plus its update and DLC if you have them:

```
/Volumes/GameData/AnimalCrossing/
  Animal Crossing New Horizons [01006F8002326000][v0].nsp
  Animal Crossing New Horizons [01006F8002326800][v2228224].nsp
```

NSZ and XCZ files (compressed NSPs and XCIs) work too: the script converts them once with [nsz](https://github.com/nicoboss/nsz) (`python3 -m pip install nsz`) and keeps the NSPs in `<title ID>_build/nsp/`, which takes their full size on disk.

The AnimalDuo extensions target ACNH 3.0.3 (v2228224). The generic upstream pipeline can attempt other versions: the script packs the newest version in the folder. DLC is optional too: the DLC in the folder is packed, and without it the game sees none, as on a Switch without it. Each game was tested on one version (the version named in its profile). With another version the script builds the game with that version's own shaders and says that the version was not tested; fixes made for the tested version's code, including the resident and companion hooks, don't apply to it.

**3. Run the script:**

```
python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py /Volumes/GameData/AnimalCrossing -k /Volumes/GameData/keys/prod.keys
```

The IPA appears in the same folder (here `/Volumes/GameData/AnimalCrossing/AnimalCrossing.ipa`). The first build takes 30–60 minutes. A later one reuses every step whose inputs did not change, so after a pull that changes only the host it takes about a minute. The small `.idx` file beside the IPA (`.app.key` beside a Mac app) records what was packed; keep it for the next build. You need free disk space of about twice the NSPs' size plus 10 GB. Options such as `-o` (output path) and `--app-name` are listed by `-h`.

**4. Install** the IPA with your sideloading tool (AltStore, Sideloadly, LiveContainer, …). The app gets the game's name, icon and version (the update's version, for example 1.2.1 for Mario Wonder; the base game's when there is no update). Sign it with the **Increased Memory Limit** capability (`com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit`) if your tool can: without it iOS gives the app about 3.4 GB and closes the bigger games (Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity and Hades II use more, Breath of the Wild and Cuphead come close); with it a recent iPhone gives about 6 GB.

To play on a Mac with Apple silicon instead, `--platform mac-app` packs a Mac app of the game that you open from Finder ([A Mac app](docs/development.md#a-mac-app)).

With an Apple developer account you can instead build and install from Xcode: `--prepare-xcode` makes an Xcode project for the game rather than an IPA ([Build and run on a device with Xcode](docs/development.md#build-and-run-on-a-device-with-xcode)).

## Play

**Settings.** A screen before the game starts offers what the game supports: frame rate, render scale, docked or handheld mode, game language, the frame-rate counter and rumble. Everything is on one scrollable screen, grouped into **Game**, **Controls** and **Performance**, with menus, sliders and a reset to the settings the game was tested with. Tap **Play** to start; the app remembers your choices. What each setting does: [Settings](docs/settings.md).

**Touch controls.** Tap **2D** / **3D** at the top to switch layouts; the app remembers your choice. Wonder, Engage, Dread, 13 Sentinels, Link's Awakening, Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, Unicorn Overlord, Rhythm Heaven Groove, Octopath Traveler 0, Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Cuphead, Absolum, Brain Memory Training Academy, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, STEINS;GATE RE:BOOT, Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain, Patrick's Parabox, Celeste, Raging Loop and Mario vs. Donkey Kong start in 2D, the other games in 3D (STEINS;GATE RE:BOOT's quick save is R3, in the 3D layout). In 3D, the right stick (the camera in most games) is not drawn: swipe on the right third of the screen, starting anywhere off the buttons. In Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2, other touches outside the controls move the pointer; in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker they touch the game's screen (touch blocks, stun enemies), and in Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain too (its menus and activities).
A connected game controller hides the touch controls and keeps every button.

**Rumble.** Game vibration uses the iPhone's haptic engine or a compatible connected controller. Controllers with separate left/right haptic outputs keep those effects separate. The launcher's **Game rumble** and **Rumble strength** settings control it independently of **Touch feedback**. Phone rumble approximates the Switch's effects; physical feel and controller compatibility still need device testing.

**Shaking.** Shake the iPhone to shake the controller, in games that read its motion: Super Mario Odyssey's motion moves (such as the cap throw on a shake) need it, and Odyssey only takes them in its default docked mode. A light bump does not count; a sharp flick of the phone does.

- **Game language** is English by default. Pick another when packing with `--language` (`-l`), by code or by name: `-l ja`, `-l zh-Hans`, `-l French` (`LANGUAGE` in Spyder). It must be one the game has; the script prints the game's languages and stops on one it lacks. To change it without rebuilding, pick another on the settings screen.
- **Saves and logs** are in the Files app, under the app's name: `save/` and `log.txt`. When something goes wrong, send `log.txt` (the previous run is `log.prev.txt`).
- **Short stutters** the first time a new scene appears are normal: the app compiles graphics for it once and remembers them for the next launch. What it remembered, and what the game's list names, is built before the game starts, behind "Preparing shaders" and a progress bar when that takes more than half a second.
- **Reinstalling:** some sideloading tools give a reinstalled app a new data folder. Copy `save/` and `pso_user.tsv` over from the old one to keep your progress.
- **Settings in a file:** lines like `DM_OPMODE=0` (handheld mode: lower resolution, higher frame rate) in `Documents/env.txt` win over the settings screen, which then shows them greyed out. `DM_FPS_TARGET=30` keeps Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, Octopath Traveler 0 and Octopath Traveler II at their original 30 fps, which saves battery; `DM_PRESENT_INTERVAL=game` does the same for Monster Train 2. `DM_SHOW_FPS=1` shows the frame rate at the top left (`--show-fps` when packing turns it on from the start). `DM_LAUNCHER=0` skips the settings screen.

## Known issues

- No amiibo and no online features.
- Fire Emblem Engage: after switching away from the app and back, some sounds may stay silent until you restart it.
- Fire Emblem: Three Houses: small square patches on the ground where decals land.
- Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2: effects drawn as points or lines come out one pixel wide.
